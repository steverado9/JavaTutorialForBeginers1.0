    What is an array?
An array is a variable that can store multiple values.
The index in which array values are stored are called position.
The index of an array starts from zero(0).
note: you can only store values with the same data types.
    How to declare an array and initialize an array
datatype[] arrayName = {};
    or
int arrayName[] = {};
    To access an element in an array
arrayName[elementIndex];

    What are access modifiers
Access allows you to access methods, class, attributes.
when you don't declare an access modifier, the default access will be in the same class and same package
    Types of Access Modifiers
Public: When you use this access modifier, it means the variable, class or method is visible everywhere.
private: This is only accessible with the class
protected: Restricts the visibility to the class, package and subclass
note: Good practice always declare your attribute variable as private of protected
You give that public access to your getters and setters

    Polymorphism in Java
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to have different forms.

    What is an abstract class
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated.
Meaning you cannot make an object of this class.
This can be done by adding the keyword "abstract" as a modifier to the class
This means we are restricting the access of the class but we an access the content of an abstract class if we create a child(subclass) of the abstract class.
    What is an abstract method
An abstract method is implemented by the subclass inheriting the abstract class
Meaning an abstract method is empty(it has no body) and we can define the content of the abstract method in the subclass.
we can make a method abstract by adding the "abstract" keyword in front of the method.
    Concrete class
This is almost the opposite of an abstract class.
If abstract class cannot be instantiated, the concrete class can be instantiated.
You just need to remove the keyword "abstract" to make a class concrete.

    Java Interfaces
Interface is the same as an abstract class
That is, interface is another way to handle abstraction.
An interface can also not be instantiated.
To declare an interface, we use the keyword "interface", the name of the interface and curly braces.
interface methods are abstract by nature, you don't need to add the abstract keyword.
To inherit from an interface, we use the keyword "implement".

    Recursion in java
Recursion is when a method is called inside its own body.
That is a method that calls himself.
example of this is used in solving factoria.

     Arraylist in Java
problem with arrays
-We have to provide the initial size of the array.
-The size of the array is fixed.
    What is an arraylist
Arraylist: This helps us use and maintain a simple array and the size of the array is dynamic.

    LinkedList
A linkedlist is also a type of list that holds multiple values

    Difference between LinkedList vs ArrayList in Java
-LinkedList element Insertion is faster compared to ArrayList.
-ArrayList search operation is fast compared to the LinkedList search operation.
-LinkedList doesn't provide Random or index based access and you need to iterate over linked list to retrieve any element.
-Linkedlist element deletion is faster compared to ArrayList.
-Linkedlist has more memory overhead than ArrayList because in ArrayList, each index only holds actual object
but in case of linkedlist, each node holds both data and address of next and previous node.

    HashSet in Java
HashSet belongs to the set category
A set only contains unique element, does not accept duplicate.

     Catching and Handling Exceptions in Java using Try Catch Blocks
Exception: This is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, that can disrupt the normal flow of the program's instruction.
We can catch/handle exceptions using try catch block.
If we don't know the type of exception we are handling , we just use the type "Exception" in the catch block
-You can add multiple catch block to a try block.
    Java Finally block
We use the finally block whenever we have the try catch block
This ensures that the finally block is executed even if an unexpected exception occurs or not.

    Using Date & Time + formatting Date using SimpleDateFormat
To get the current date and time,
Create an object of Date class and call toString method on it.
google simpledateformat to see the alphabets used for different types of date format.
