    What is an array?
An array is a variable that can store multiple values.
The index in which array values are stored are called position.
The index of an array starts from zero(0).
note: you can only store values with the same data types.
    How to declare an array and initialize an array
datatype[] arrayName = {};
    or
int arrayName[] = {};
    To access an element in an array
arrayName[elementIndex];

    What are access modifiers
Access allows you to access methods, class, attributes.
when you don't declare an access modifier, the default access will be in the same class and same package
    Types of Access Modifiers
Public: When you use this access modifier, it means the variable, class or method is visible everywhere.
private: This is only accessible with the class
protected: Restricts the visibility to the class, package and subclass
note: Good practice always declare your attribute variable as private of protected
You give that public access to your getters and setters
